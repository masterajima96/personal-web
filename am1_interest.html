      <h3>About the Recipe</h3>

<p>Biryani is a mixed rice dish originating among the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent. 
It is made with Indian spices, rice, and meat, and sometimes, 
in addition, eggs and/or vegetables such as potatoes in certain regional varieties. 
Biryani is popular throughout the Indian subcontinent, as well as among its diaspora..</p>

<p>Biryanis have more complex and stronger spices compared to pulao. 
The British-era author Abdul Halim Sharar mentions 
the following as their primary difference: biryani has a stronger taste of curried rice due to a greater amount of spices</p>
    </aside>
    <p>In biryani, meat (and vegetables, if present) and rice are cooked separately
	before being layered and cooked together. Pulao is a single-pot dish: 
	meat (or vegetables) and rice are simmered in a liquid until the liquid is absorbed. 
	However, some other writers, such as Holly Shaffer (based on her observations in Lucknow), 
	R. K. Saxena and Sangeeta Bhatnagar have reported pulao recipes
	in which the rice and meat are cooked separately and then mixed before the dum cooking</p>
